# Train-Scheduler
Project using Google Firebase as a database exercise in train scheduling.

Thomas the Dank Engine is hilarious to me. I used to love the Thomas TV Show as a kid.

This project uses Moment.JS to pull in correct dates and times to alert the user about train frequency and how many minutes until the next train. Users can input their own train values, which are stored on Firebase and added to the HTML using JQuery.

The web page was constructed using Bootstrap.
